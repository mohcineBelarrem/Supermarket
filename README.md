# Supermarket App


This app was a playground for me to learn SwiftUI, Combine, and SwiftData. In the mean time apply the principles of SOLID and the VIPER architecture.
It's a Supermarket app based on the API from Valentin Despa documented here 
https://github.com/vdespa/Postman-Complete-Guide-API-Testing/blob/main/simple-grocery-store-api.md





## Table of Contents

1. [API Status Screen](#APIStatus) 
2. [Product List Screen](#ProductList)  



  <h2 id="APIStatus">API Status Screen</h2>
  The First Screen the user sees is the APIStatus Screen, In this screen we call the /status endpoint and we expect a Status of "UP".
  After that the user is redirected to product listing or an Error screen is shown.
